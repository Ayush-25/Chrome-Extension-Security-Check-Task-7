### Step 2: Review Installed Extensions  
Carefully reviewed all installed extensions one by one.  

**List of Installed Extensions (with observations):**  
1. **AdBlock** – Safe, widely used for blocking ads.  
2. **Application Launcher for Drive (by Google)** – Official Google extension, safe.  
3. **Dark Reader** – Popular open-source extension, safe.  
4. **Enhancer for YouTube™** – Adds controls to YouTube, generally safe.  
5. **Free VPN for Chrome - VPN Proxy VeePN** – ⚠️ *Potential Risk* (VPN extensions often track browsing data).  
6. **Google Docs Offline** – Official Google extension, safe.  
7. **INSSIST | Web Client for Instagram** – ⚠️ *Medium Risk* (third-party Instagram automation can be risky).  
8. **JSON Formatter** – Open-source, widely trusted.  

*Screenshot:* Scroll through all installed extensions showing names and IDs.

### Step 3: Identify Suspicious / Unstable Extensions  
- **Free VPN for Chrome - VeePN** → Risky, as many free VPNs log user activity.  
- **INSSIST (Instagram automation)** → Can raise security/privacy concerns.  
- All other extensions are **trusted and commonly used**.

---

### Step 5: Best Practices & Lessons Learned
